# CASP15 RNA assesment - cryoEM
For the CASP15 RNA category, we aimed to assess predictions by directly comparing to expiremental data. In the respository is all scripts and code used to obtain and analyse scores. All map-to-model scores used are molecule agnostic and thus can be applied to RNA as here or other molecules, however, some of the pre-processing and other scores herein are RNA specific.
